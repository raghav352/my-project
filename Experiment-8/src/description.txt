We built a React-based Library Management app where users can:

View a list of books with title and author.

Search books dynamically by typing in a search box (filters by title or author).

Add new books through an input form.

Remove books using a button next to each item.

The app uses React state management (useState) to handle book data, search terms, and form inputs.
 It demonstrates event handling (typing, adding, removing) and dynamic rendering, 
 so the UI updates instantly without reloading the page.
