We built a small React project to practice inheritance in JavaScript ES6 classes.

Created a base Person class with name and age properties plus a displayInfo() method.

Made two subclasses: Student (adds course) and Teacher (adds subject), each overriding displayInfo().

Put all class definitions inside a separate file (PersonClasses.jsx) for better structure.

In App.jsx, imported these classes, created sample objects (Student and Teacher), and used React state to display their info dynamically.

Added two buttons (Show Student Info / Show Teacher Info) that update the UI with details from the respective class instance.

ðŸ‘‰ This demonstrated object-oriented programming concepts (inheritance, method overriding) inside a modern React app with clean modularization.
