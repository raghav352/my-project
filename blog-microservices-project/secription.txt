We have successfully built a foundational, full-stack Microservices-based Blogging Platform from the ground up, moving from conceptual architecture to running code.

Key Achievements: Architecture and Implementation
Microservices Architecture: We established three separate, independent Node.js (Express) microservices, each owning its specific domain data:

User Service: Manages authentication (Registration/Login) and user data.

Post Service: Manages blog content.

Comment Service: Manages comments, linking them to specific posts and users.

Data Isolation (Own-Your-Data): Each service runs its own isolated MongoDB database (orchestrated via Docker Compose).

API Gateway: We implemented a central API Gateway which acts as the single entry point. It handles:

Routing requests to the correct downstream service.

Authentication and Authorization (validating JWTs).

Context Propagation (injecting user ID/role into headers for downstream services).

Inter-Service Communication (ISC): We demonstrated how services talk to each other (e.g., the Post Service calling the User Service to fetch an author's username).

Deployment: We containerized the entire system using Docker and orchestrated it using Docker Compose, ensuring easy setup and reliable networking between services.

Frontend Integration: We built a basic React frontend that consumes the API Gateway, implementing the complete authentication flow (Login/Register) to interact with the protected backend resources.
